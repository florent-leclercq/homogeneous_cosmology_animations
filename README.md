This repository contains some python scripts producing plots and animations to explain homogeneous cosmology within different models (standard cold dark matter, Lambda cold dark matter, and dynamic dark energy). They are meant mostly for outreach purposes.

This material has been originally used in my talk at the 33ème Festival d'Astronomie de Fleurance (2023) : "Le satellite Euclid et l'analyse de ses données : énergie noire, information et incertitudes".

Captions and labels are intentionally not included in the plots/animations.
